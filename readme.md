Line-by-line Explanation
def fibonacci(n):

This defines a function named fibonacci that takes one argument, n, which represents how many Fibonacci numbers you want.
a, b = 0, 1

Initializes two variables: a is set to 0 (the first Fibonacci number), and b is set to 1 (the second Fibonacci number).
for _ in range(n):

This loop will run n times. Each time, it generates the next Fibonacci number.
print(a, end=' ')

Prints the current value of a (the next Fibonacci number) on the same line, separated by a space.
a, b = b, a + b

Updates a and b for the next iteration:
a takes the value of b.
b takes the value of a + b (the sum of the previous two numbers).
This is how the Fibonacci sequence is generated.
fibonacci(10)

Calls the function to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
Output
When you run the code, it prints:

Code
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
Each number is the sum of the previous two, starting from 0 and 1. This is the Fibonacci series.
